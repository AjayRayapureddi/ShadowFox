ENHANCED CALCULATOR
--------------------------------------------------
Overview:
--------------

This project, developed as part of my Java Development Internship with ShadowFox, is a console-based calculator that includes not only basic arithmetic operations but also scientific calculations and unit conversions. The calculator is designed to provide an extended range of functionalities beyond standard calculators, making it useful for a variety of mathematical and unit conversion tasks.

Features:
------------
1. Basic Arithmetic Operations:
The calculator can perform the following operations:

	*Addition
	*Subtraction
	*Multiplication
	*Division (with error handling for division by zero)

2. Scientific Calculations:
	*Square Root Calculation: Calculates the square root of a number, with validation for non-negative input.
	*Exponentiation: Allows users to raise a number to a specified power.

3. Unit Conversions:
	*Temperature Conversion: Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
	*Currency Conversion: Convert between USD and INR based on a predefined exchange rate.

Technologies Used:
---------------------------
	-> Java: The entire calculator was built using Java, focusing on methods, control flow, and error handling.
	->Java Math Library: Utilized for square root and exponentiation calculations.

Key Concepts and Learnings:
----------------------------------------
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of:

	*Java Syntax and Methods: Organized the code into modular methods for each type of operation, which keeps the code maintainable and easy to read.
	*Error Handling: Included error checks for operations like divide-by-zero and negative inputs for square roots.
	*Control Structures: Used switch-case statements for user selections, enhancing usability.
	*Input Validation: Added input validation to avoid invalid operations, increasing reliability.

Code Structure:
---------------------
	*EnhancedCalculator.java: Main Java file containing all methods for arithmetic operations, scientific calculations, and unit conversions.

Example Usage:
----------------------
	*Arithmetic Operation: Enter two numbers, select the operation (e.g., addition), and view the result.
	*Scientific Calculation: Select square root or exponentiation, enter the required number(s), and view the result.
	*Unit Conversion: Select a conversion (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit), enter the value, and view the result.

Future Enhancements:
------------------------------
	#Additional scientific functions (e.g., trigonometric functions).
	#More unit conversions, such as length or weight.
	Note: A graphical user interface (GUI) to make the calculator even more user-friendly.
